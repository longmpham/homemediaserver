1. install OMV on a USB, use Rufus or Etcher, etc to put the ISO on it
2. follow setup guide, should be self explanatory. Recommend Ethernet but wifi can work too.
- if you choose wifi, we will set a static IP later
3. Reboot the computer and boot into OMV
- if the IP address is incorrect on the boot up CLI, go to your router and find it OR
- login with user:root and pw:<what_you_set> in the CLI and type 'ip addr'
4. Setup some basic house keeping under System such as:
- PW change 
- date/time
5. Setup static IP by going to Network > Interfaces and edit the connection listed
-IPv4
-- Method: Static
-- Address: 192.168.50.x
-- Netmask: 255.255.255.0
-- Gateway: 192.168.50.1 (your router usually)
- nameserver (DNS)
-- DNS servers: 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
6. Setup OMV extras by using a terminal or the original CLI
wget -O - https://github.com/OpenMediaVault-Plugin-Developers/packages/raw/master/install | bash
- after it finishes, reboot the computer
7. Go to System > omv-extras and select Docker and Save it. After it completes, Enable Backports
8. Go to System > Plugins and find and install:
- flashmemory
- docker-compose
9. DISK MANAGEMENT TIME!
