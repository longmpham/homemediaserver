first, Inside your Ubuntu guest, make sure your iGPU is detected :
    cd /dev/dri && ls -l
This command should show this line :
    crw-rw---- 1 root render 226, 128 Jun 22 02:02 renderD128
renderD128 is usually your iGPU. Make note of the group. In this case it' "render", 
if it's different this will be relevant for the next step. I will be installing Jellyfin 
using docker (using the official image), this is by far the fastest way to get up 
and going at this point (the image comes with the necessary stuff).
I recommend you refer to the Jellyfin official doc, but here's what I did :
Figure out the id of the render group. (If your group is different, check for its id)
    getent group render | cut -d: -f3
here's an example output:
    long@long-mini:/dev/dri$ getent group render | cut -d: -f3
    110

configure your docker compose:

  # Alternative to Plex (Open Source, Free!)
  jellyfin:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:latest
    container_name: jellyfin
    hostname: jellyfin
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - PUID=${PUID}
      - PGID=${PGID}
      - TZ=${TIMEZONE}
      - UMASK=002
    volumes:
      - ${ROOT_DIR}/config/jellyfin:/config
      - ${ROOT_DIR}/config/jellyfin/cache:/cache
      - ${ROOT_DIR}/data:/data
      - ${ROOT_DIR}/data/media/movies:/movies
      - ${ROOT_DIR}/data/media/tvshows/:/tvshows
      - ${ROOT_DIR}/data/media/anime:/anime
      - ${ROOT_DIR}/data/media/music:/music
      - ${ROOT_DIR}/data/media/books:/books
      - ${ROOT_DIR}/data/media/other:/other
    ports:
      - 8096:8096
    devices:
      - /dev/dri:/dev/dri
      - /dev/dri/renderD128:/dev/dri/renderD128
    group_add:
      - "110"

    Group_add => I specified the id of the render group that we fetched earlier
    Network_mode:"host" => I use this to have DLNA enabled with my Samsung TVs
    Devices => pass the entire device (iGPU) to the docker container

After the Docker container is up and running (and healthy), set it up normally.
To enable hardware acceleration, go into : Administration > Dashboard > Playback
Enable Intel QuickSync with these options :
Codecs :
    All but VC1 and VP8 (somehow VC1 didn't work for me with UHD 770)
Hardware encodings :
    All
    Low power mode YES : worked out of the box for me (that's 12th gen thing maybe)
