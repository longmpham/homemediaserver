Tdarr configuration from Ubuntu as Server and Windows as Node

1. Run the Tdarr docker. Make sure the Server and Node are running the same version. 
If not, change the config file and/or the docker image

image: ghcr.io/haveagitgat/tdarr:2.13.01 # windows version currently on this one.
# image: ghcr.io/haveagitgat/tdarr:latest

2. Set up your drives, or network drives such that both Server and Node can see them. 
In Ubuntu, the path will be something like the following (local -> docker):
/media/drivepool -> /drivepool

In Windows, the path will be something like the following:
U:/<drivepool>

These paths need to be configured on the Windows side under the Tdarr_Node_Config.json file
Tip: Configure one for your drivepool and one for your transcode cache
...
...  
"pathTranslators": [
    {
      "server": "/drivepool",
      "node": "U:/"
    },
    {
      "server": "/temp",
      "node": "K:/transcode"
    }
  ],
...
...

What this is saying is "Map the server's path to the Windows path". Keep in mind, they are not 2 different locations
but the same location, just named differently as Ubuntu and Windows are not using the same path conventions.

3. Setup your Tdarr as you would normally. Go into your <server_ip>/<server_web_ui_port> (ie. 192.168.50.2:8265) and 
configure your Libraries and Plugins, etc.

4. If you run into permission issues, make sure to do the following when mounting (or follow the mount_*.txt files)
To mount temporarily:
sudo mkdir /mnt/windows_share
sudo mount.cifs //SERVER/SHARE /mnt/windows_share -o username=your_username,password=your_password,file_mode=0775,dir_mode=0775

To mount permanently in /etc/fstab (on boot):
sudo nano /etc/fstab
# //SERVER/SHARE /mnt/windows_share cifs username=your_username,password=your_password,file_mode=0775,dir_mode=0775 0 0
//192.168.50.2 /mmt/windows_share cifs username=user@outlook.com,password=password123,pid=1000,gid=1000,file_mode=0775,dir_mode=0775 0 0
sudo mount -a

tip: follow the mount_windows_share_to_linux_permanently.txt as it will guide you to create a password file and keep it read only to root such that you can use this within your /etc/fstab file.
