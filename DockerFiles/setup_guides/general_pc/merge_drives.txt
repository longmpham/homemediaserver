To use mergefs, run the ./merge_drives.sh script. Make sure to update the drive paths and merge path!
(doesn't work atm...
)
To  revert the mergefs, you'll have to unmount the merged folder
sudo umount /mnt/merged

Finally, delete the folder. This will not delete your data!
sudo rm -r /mnt/merged


Note for unmounting/removing folder:
Unmounting the merged filesystem and removing the mount point (/mnt/merged in this case) 
will not delete the data stored on the underlying drives (/mnt/drive1, /mnt/drive2, /mnt/drive3). 
It only removes the merged view of the filesystem, effectively reverting the system to its state 
before the merge operation.

Here's what happens when you unmount and remove the mount point:
    Unmounting the merged filesystem: The umount command detaches the merged filesystem from 
    the specified mount point (/mnt/merged). This means that the merged filesystem is no longer 
    accessible through that mount point, but the data on the underlying drives remains intact.

    Removing the mount point: The rm -r /mnt/merged command recursively deletes the mount 
    point directory (/mnt/merged). This removes only the directory and its contents, 
    including the merged view of the filesystem. Again, the data on the underlying drives 
    (/mnt/drive1, /mnt/drive2, /mnt/drive3) is not affected.
